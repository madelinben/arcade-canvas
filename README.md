## üêû BUGS!
***Header:***
* [ ] Grow highlighted elements to further show selectability.
* [ ] Encapsulate page sections within a centered 80vw wrapper to align everything.

***Account:***
* [ ] Account input elements are converting lowercase characters to allcaps.
* [ ] Success and Error messages are wrapping flex elements.

***Gallery:***
* [ ] Ensure project tiles are fixed to 300x300 scale.
* [ ] Overflow the content section and position the footer relative to the bottom.

***Footer:***
* [ ] Text decoration on credit repo link.

***Project:***
* [ ] Existing game graphics need to be scaled on window resize.
* [ ] Game frame rate should increase exponentially as the rounds go on.

***Pong:***
* [ ] Ball angle should initially travel towards the winning player. Game is currently just randomising the angle.
* [ ] Ball y velocity is not changed when the underside of the paddle is hit.

***Snake:***
* [ ] Snake game needs to terminate if the snake head collides outside the canvas boundary.
