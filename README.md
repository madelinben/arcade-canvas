## 🐞 BUGS!
***Web Dev:***
* [ ] Text decoration on credit repo link.
* [ ] Existing game graphics need to be scaled on window resize.
* [ ] Account input elements are converting lowercase characters to allcaps.
* [ ] Success and Error messages are wrapping flex elements.

***Pong:***
* [ ] Ball angle should initially travel towards the winning player. Game is currently just randomising the angle.
* [ ] Ball y velocity is not changed when the underside of the paddle is hit.
